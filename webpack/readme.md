- Create a dist directory
- Create a src directory
- Init a npm project `npm init -y`
- Add an index.html in dist directory, with basic html template and a script tag which has src as `./main.js`
- Install required webpack dev dependencies: `npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev`
- Create an `index.js` file inside src directory and add some code to execute, 
 - If you've defined a method, make sure it's getting called, otherwise webpack would create an empty package, as nothing is being done by the scrept.

- Run webpack command to generate a package:
    - `npx webpack --mode production`
    - A new `main.js` package/file is created inside `dist` directory, which should already be included in `index.html` in 3rd step.
